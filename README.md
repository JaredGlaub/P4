# P4
Graph Processor class implements the Floyd-Warshall shortest path algorithm. 
### Notes
The getShortestPath and getShortestDistance methods depend on how the graph class is implemented. Using an adjacency matrix would make the most sense because iteration through vertices would be quicker. Also adding indexes to each String graph vertex would make it much easier to implement as well.
